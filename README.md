![gradio](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a0cd5b37-0144-493f-9fb1-ceb83588bbe6)

This project demonstrates how to create an interactive word cloud application using the Gradio library in Python. Gradio is a user-friendly framework that allows you to quickly build and share web interfaces for machine learning models and data science workflows. In this project, I have implemented a simple interface where users can input text, and the application generates a word cloud based on the frequency of the words.

Features:

Interactive web interface for text input.
Dynamic word cloud generation.
Simple and easy-to-use UI powered by Gradio.
Easily deployable on any web server or cloud platform.
Technologies Used:

Python
Gradio Library
WordCloud Library
How to Use:

Clone the repository.
Install the required dependencies.
Run the application locally or deploy it to a cloud platform.
Enter your text into the provided input box and generate your word cloud.
